# ***Phase 1***

This program***(wff-evaluator.cpp)*** receives two logical statements **WFF** in the form of two strings, if the two statements are equivalent, the output will be one, otherwise it will be zero.

**Remark:**
* Only lowercase Latin letters can be used as variables.
* T is used to indicate the always true statement and F is used to represent the always false statement.
* Well-known operators for this program are: {\\/, /\\, ~, ->, <->}

**Requirement:**
I used visual studio 2019.


# ***Phase 2***

In this phase I have implemented the program ***wff-2-postfix-calculator.cpp*** which receives a well-arranged computational expression (WFF) as input and prints the equivalent postfix string and the result of the computational expression in the output.

**Remark:**
* All numbers in the input are natural numbers from one to nine.
* The program has the ability to work with five operators +, -, *, / and ^.
