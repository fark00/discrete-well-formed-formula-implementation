# ***Phase 1***

This program receives two logical statements **WFF** in the form of two strings, if the two statements are equivalent, the output will be one, otherwise it will be zero.

**Remark:**
* Only lowercase Latin letters can be used as variables.
* T is used to indicate the always true statement and F is used to represent the always false statement.
* Well-known operators for this program are: {\\/, /\\, ~, ->, <->}

**Requirement:**
I used visual studio 2019.
